It's difficult to find an academically rigorous timeline that covers all of the events relevant to the history of life in the universe. Because of the way scientific disciplines tend to be divided, most timelines focus on events relevant to one particular branch of science. So, for example, an astronomical timeline would focus a lot on the physics of the early universe and the evolution of the cosmos as a whole, while largely ignoring events occurring on individual planets (such as Earth). Geologists and Earth scientists make timelines of \"deep time\", but those timelines typically start after Earth has formed, largely omitting ~9 billion years of cosmic history. Biological timelines tend to speed through everything up until the Cambrian explosion, around 500 million years ago, lumping more than 13 billion years of cosmic history into a vague \"pre-Cambrian\" period. With those caveats in mind, here are a few timelines that should help:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA somewhat cursory review of the history of the cosmos, including the pre-Earth time: \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_Calendar\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_Calendar\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA history of life on Earth: \u003ca href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17453-timeline-the-evolution-of-life/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17453-timeline-the-evolution-of-life/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA history of life on Earth since the Cambrian explosion: \u003ca href=\"https://natmus.humboldt.edu/exhibits/life-through-time/visual-timeline\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://natmus.humboldt.edu/exhibits/life-through-time/visual-timeline\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLearning Goals: \u003c/strong\u003eBy the end of this week, students will be able to:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSummarize key events in the history of the universe that led to the development of life.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDescribe the most severe mass extinction in the history of Earth and its potential astrobiological significance.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCorrectly use geologic terminology to describe major periods in the history of Earth.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCorrectly use basic astronomical vocabulary, such as \"solar system\", \"galaxy\", \"universe\", and \"light year\".\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eExplain Fermi's Paradox and suggest possible resolutions.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWeek 2: January 17 – The Definition and Chemistry of Life\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReadings:\u003c/strong\u003e Chapter 1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLearning Goals: \u003c/strong\u003eBy the end of this week, students will be able to:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eArgue for an astrobiologically relevant definition of \"life\" and describe its limitations.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDescribe the main chemical constituents of Earth life\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMake a case for why carbon is the atom on which Earth life is based\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMake a case for why water is the primary solvent for Earth life\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDescribe alternative chemistries for life that may be possible\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCritically assess the argument that carbon is the only atom on which life can be based\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eExplain why Earth life is limited to a particular range of physical conditions\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDescribe those conditions\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGive examples of extremophile lifeforms and their implications for the survivability of non-terrestrial environments\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWeek 3: January 24 – Planetary Habitability\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReadings:\u003c/strong\u003e Chapter 2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also recommend you read (or skim) chapters 17 and 22 of the free OpenStax Astronomy textbook, which you can read online or download for free (\u003ca href=\"https://cnx.org/contents/LnN76Opl\"\u003ehttps://cnx.org/contents/LnN76Opl\u003c/a\u003e).

As is the case in real astronomical observations, the measurements are not made at equal time intervals. In real observations, many factors affect the timing or \"cadence\" of the observations.

Similarly, the column labelled \"brightness\" is expressed in units of solar luminosities.

Your goal is not to try to \"look up\" the category name the type of planet you have discovered, but to build a case for your interpretation of its type by making reference to your data.

Unlike the sound made by a waterfall or the wind rustling the leaves of a tree, the sounds your dog makes aren't random vibrations of the air. Similarly, if you come across text written in a language you don't understand, by examining the frequency with which certain letters appear and by noticing repeated patterns, you could determine that the text represented some kind of language, and not a random string of characters generated by a computer.

Ocean tides, variable stars, and even something as simple as dripping water all represent natural but highly repetitive patterns.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you decide that your message is of intelligent origin, you should try to decode its contents.

It's difficult to find an academically rigorous timeline that covers all of the events relevant to the history of life in the universe. Because of the way scientific disciplines tend to be divided, most timelines focus on events relevant to one particular branch of science. So, for example, an astronomical timeline would focus a lot on the physics of the early universe and the evolution of the cosmos as a whole, while largely ignoring events occurring on individual planets (such as Earth). Geologists and Earth scientists make timelines of \"deep time\", but those timelines typically start after Earth has formed, largely omitting ~9 billion years of cosmic history. Biological timelines tend to speed through everything up until the Cambrian explosion, around 500 million years ago, lumping more than 13 billion years of cosmic history into a vague \"pre-Cambrian\" period.

Similarly, the column labelled \"brightness\" is expressed in units of solar luminosities.

As described in class, there are many broad categories of planets, such as \"terrestrial\", \"hot Jupiter\", or \"ocean world\", but these are not to rigorously defined and some of these categories may overlap with one another. Your goal is not to try to \"look up\" the category name the type of planet you have discovered, but to build a case for your interpretation of its type by making reference to your data. For example, you might conclude that the planet is a \"lava world\", by making reference to its size and equilibrium temperature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn some cases, it may be difficult to answer all of the questions listed in item 4 above. For example, if the transit for a given planet is very shallow, short, or poorly sampled (i.e. the cadence of observations is very low), you may have difficulty measuring some of the desired parameters.

Unlike the sound made by a waterfall or the wind rustling the leaves of a tree, the sounds your dog makes aren't random vibrations of the air. Similarly, if you come across text written in a language you don't understand, by examining the frequency with which certain letters appear and by noticing repeated patterns, you could determine that the text represented some kind of language, and not a random string of characters generated by a computer.

Ocean tides, variable stars, and even something as simple as dripping water all represent natural but highly repetitive patterns.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you decide that your message is of intelligent origin, you should try to decode its contents.

They are intended to account for things like illnesses and emergency absences. If you use them up because of poor time management and then get sick later, no additional allowance will be made. This is to be fair to other students.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eYou may request a total of 10 days' extension across all three projects. You are responsible for keeping track of how many days of extension you have requested and ensuring that the total does not exceed 10 (even though Quercus will allow you to request more).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIf you request a total of more than 10 days of extension, we will apply a late penalty for any additional days (for example, if you ask for 12 days, we will apply 2 days' late penalty on the project that exceeds the 10 days' allowance).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo ensure that we can submit final grades on time, the maximum extension for the final project will be 5 days.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eExtensions will not be reflected in the due date you see on Quercus before submitting your project. If the deadline on Quercus is March 21 at noon, and you request 3 days extension, you can submit your project until March 24 at noon without penalty.
